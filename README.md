### How to use
```
git clone this thing
npm install
edit tokens.json
node index.js
```

You can use `--screenshot` to take screenshots of the pages to make sure they are logged in, and you can use `--headless-off` to see the chromium browser

The `password` branch is a different version that works on using a username and password to login instead
